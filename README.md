# Face and Emotion Detection using CNN

This project is an implementation of emotion detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses the FER2013 dataset for training and validation.


## Dataset: 
(FER2013) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013



## Running the project
To run this project, follow the steps below:

- Open Google Colab or any other Python IDE 
- Upload emotion_detection.py file.
- Upload the dataset.zip file in the same directory as the notebook file/ working directory.
- Open the notebook and run the cells in order.


## Results

Results Analysis

On fine tuning various parameters, We observed that the best overall validation accuracy of the model achieved after 50 epochs and 455 steps in each epoch is 86.89% whereas the validation accuracy achieved is 85.7%.
The image below shows the accuracy achieved at the end of these 50 epochs.



Below listed are the results of various images captured live, and the model detects the face from an image and classifies the image into an emotion with the highest probability. Below listed are some of the best results fetched.










Fig 5.1 Model shows the happy emotion with 80% confidence











Fig 5.2 Model shows the neutral emotion with 99.99% confidence










Fig 5.3 Model shows sad emotion with 78.99% confidence




## Note

This project requires an internet connection to download the required libraries and dataset.
The training process may take several minutes or even hours depending on your hardware and internet speed.
